# Changelog

All notable changes to The Thousand and First. Versions are semantic: patch for fixes,
minor for additive API and content, major for breaking changes. Supported API is defined in
[docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## [Unreleased] — 0.2.0 in progress

Pre-release: the mod has not yet run in a live game. Nothing here is stable until the first
playtest passes.

### Added
- Founding by water rite: the founder's basin item (obtainable from tier-1 merchants), the
  Charter activated ability, and the kingdom faction with its own standings ledger.
- Growth engine: witnessed arrivals with settler provenance and conversations, water
  fetching from open sources into dedicated stores, growth stages Camp through City.
- The thirst ladder: upkeep, warnings, bounded emigration, the withered state, and full
  recovery when water returns.
- Territory: adjacency-gated claims, districts with Qudish names (vinelands, bazaar,
  forgeworks, sacred ground, watch, scriptorium).
- Commission construction: scaffolds that complete into real buildings over time.
- Raids: provocation-keyed, telegraphed, tribute-able, with plunder.
- Trade charters: standing-gated deals, caravan arrivals delivering water, real merchants.
- The chronicle in two registers, dated in Qud's calendar, feeding journal accomplishments.
- Extension registries — `KingdomBuildings.xml` and `KingdomDeals.xml` — loaded through the
  game's mergeable XML streams so any mod extends them without code.
- Diagnostics: `[TAF]` log lines and the `kingdom:dump` state readout.

### Notes for extenders
- The supported API is now documented in `docs/API.md`; anything absent from it is internal.
- All engine entry points are exception-guarded: our failures log and degrade, never
  propagate into the host game.

### Fixed
- Water accounting now measures actual liquid deltas, including exact vessel depletion and
  capacity-clamped fills.
- Kingdom state now uses versioned, named-field serialization. Exact petition-era development
  saves migrate once; older pre-release layouts require a fresh kingdom state.
- Charging posts now hold cells in a real inventory and emit bounded charge only while staffed.
  New posts no longer carry a capacitor: stored capacitor charge never powered the charger.
  Existing posts gain the inventory and stateless hand-crank part on their next staffing pass;
  their obsolete capacitor is discharged and removed rather than left as an explosion hazard.
