# Supported API — The Thousand and First

Everything listed here is a supported contract: it changes only under the versioning rule
in [STANDARDS.md](../STANDARDS.md) §9 (no removals in a minor release; deprecations marked
`[Obsolete]` with a named replacement and kept working for at least one minor cycle).
**Anything not listed here is internal and may change without notice** — if you need
something that isn't here, open an issue and it can be promoted deliberately.

Most extension needs no code at all: see [MODDING.md](../MODDING.md) for the XML registries
(`KingdomBuildings.xml`, `KingdomDeals.xml`), which are the preferred extension path.

## Getting the system

```csharp
using ThousandAndFirst;

KingdomSystem kingdom = XRL.The.Game.RequireSystem<KingdomSystem>();
if (kingdom.Founded) { /* ... */ }
```

`RequireSystem` creates the system if absent, so it is always safe. Every property below is
readable at any time; a kingdom that has not been founded reports `Founded == false` and
neutral values.

## `KingdomSystem` — the game system

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `bool Founded` | True once a kingdom exists. Guard every other use with this. |
| `string KingdomFactionName` / `KingdomDisplayName` | The runtime faction's name and display name; null when unfounded. |
| `string Style` | City style key (`common`, `verdant`, `fungal`, `gyre`, `eater`, or one your mod declares). Drives which building designs are offered. |
| `GrowthStage Stage` | `Camp`, `Steading`, `Village`, `Town`, `City`. Monotonic — never regresses. |
| `int Population` | Living settler count. |
| `bool Withered` | True while a sustained thirst has suspended prosperity. Recoverable. |
| `List<string> ClaimedZones` | Zone IDs the kingdom holds. |
| `Dictionary<string,string> ZoneDistricts` | Zone ID → district key. |
| `List<string> ChronicleEntries` / `OutsiderEntries` | The two registers, oldest first, capped. |
| `Dictionary<string,int> OriginCounts` | Settler origin → count (population composition). |
| `int GetStanding(string factionName)` | The kingdom's own standing with a faction — **separate from player reputation**. |
| `void SetStanding(string, int, bool mirror = true)` | Set standing and mirror the faction's feeling toward the kingdom. |
| `void AdjustStanding(string, int, bool mirror = true)` | Apply a delta. Prefer this over writing `Standings` directly. |
| `void MirrorFeeling(string factionName)` | Re-write one faction's feeling from its standing. Safe when unfounded. |
| `static void Guard(string step, Action work)` | Run work inside engine dispatch without letting exceptions escape. Use for any code the engine invokes. |

## `KingdomFounding` — founding, territory, citizenship

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `static Faction Found(string name)` | Founds the kingdom (idempotent — returns the existing faction if already founded). |
| `static bool ClaimZone(Zone z, bool force = false)` | Claims a zone; requires adjacency to existing ground unless forced. |
| `static bool EnrollCitizen(GameObject citizen)` | Makes a creature a citizen. Enrolled creatures are protected from kingdom-driven removal. |

## `KingdomChronicle` — history

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `static void Record(KingdomSystem, string text, bool accomplishment = false)` | Writes to both registers, dated. `text` is a lower-case clause with no trailing period, written from the founder's perspective. Pass `accomplishment: true` only for milestones. |

## `KingdomData` — the content registries

| Member | Contract |
|---|---|
| `static List<BuildEntry> Buildings` | All registered building designs, base plus third-party. |
| `static bool TryGetBuilding(string key, out BuildEntry)` | Look up one design. |
| `static List<DealEntry> Deals` | All registered trade charters. |
| `static bool TryGetDeal(string key, out DealEntry)` | Look up one charter. |
| `static List<string> Styles` | Declared city styles. |
| `static void Reload()` | Re-read every registry. Called on game load; call it if you inject entries at runtime. |

## `KingdomRules` — pure rules (no engine dependencies)

Deterministic, side-effect-free, and fully unit-tested; safe to call from anywhere,
including your own tests. Notable members: `SpilloverDelta`, `UpkeepForElapsed`,
`StageFor`, `FetchableDrams`, `ResolveThirst`, `RaidSize`, `StyleAllows`, `DistrictName`,
`ZonesAdjacent`, `ComposeOutsider`, `ToThirdPerson`, plus the `BuildEntry` / `DealEntry`
records and their `TryParse*` validators.

## Object properties (stable contract)

These are read and written across the mod and are part of the API:

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KingdomCitizen` (int) | Creature belongs to the kingdom. |
| `KingdomBorn` (int) | Settler created by the growth engine; only these may emigrate. |
| `KingdomStores` (int) | Container is dedicated to the settlement's water stores. **Nothing without this flag is ever consumed.** |
| `KingdomBuilt` (int) | Object was raised by a commission. |
| `KingdomRaider` (int) | Hostile spawned by a raid. |
| `KingdomCaravan` (int) | Merchant spawned by a trade charter; despawned on later visits. |
| `KingdomOrigin` (string) | Settler's region of origin. |

## Guarantees

- **The protection law**: kingdom systems never consume, move, or destroy an object the
  player or another mod placed, unless the player explicitly dedicated it. Automatic
  placement only ever targets empty cells.
- **Absence is safe**: growth, thirst, trade, and raids only resolve while the player is
  present, and consequences are bounded per visit.
- **Failures degrade**: an exception in our code is logged and skipped, never propagated
  into the host game.
