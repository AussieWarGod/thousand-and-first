# The Thousand and First — Test Session Protocol (v0.1.0)

Fresh game launch (never mid-session approval — ghost assembly generations). Approve
**The Thousand and First** at the mod prompt, then load any save or start a new game.
Say when you're launching so the log watch can run alongside.

## Pass 1 — Foundation (wishes)

| Step | Wish / action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `kingdom:found Kavvat` | Founding popup; chronicle begins; standings seeded |
| 2 | `kingdom:status` | Stage Camp, pop 0, standings summary |
| 3 | `kingdom:rep Joppa:100` | Personal rep +100; spillover popup shows kingdom standing +50 |
| 4 | `kingdom:standing Snapjaws:600` | Their feeling toward the kingdom reads 100 |
| 5 | `kingdom:claim` | Zone claimed; chronicle line with the zone's prosaic name |
| 6 | `kingdom:citizen` (stand next to a creature) | It joins; message names it |
| 7 | `kingdom:selftest` | All checks PASS in one popup |

## Pass 2 — Growth, water, and thirst

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | Drop 1–2 filled waterskins on the ground in the claimed zone | `kingdom:status` shows **0 stored** — undedicated vessels are personal and inviolate (the protection law) |
| 8a | Charter → **Dedicate a vessel to the stores** beside the waterskins | Vessels flip to [dedicated]; `kingdom:status` now counts their drams |
| 8b | Release one via the same menu | Its drams vanish from the stores; settlers will never drink it |
| 9 | `kingdom:grow` | Settler arrives (with an origin), water −2 drams, chronicle line |
| 10 | Repeat 9 to 5 settlers with 16+ drams stored | **Steading** stage-up popup + journal accomplishment |
| 11 | Empty the stores (pick containers up), `kingdom:grow` | Thirst warning (red), chronicle "thirsted" line, streak 1 |
| 12 | `kingdom:grow` again, still dry | A settler **emigrates** ("left for wetter country"), pop −1 |
| 13 | Refill water, `kingdom:grow` | Streak resets; arrivals resume |
| 14 | If the zone has a fresh-water pool: `kingdom:status` before/after `kingdom:grow` | Settlers fetch pool water into containers (stored rises, open falls) |

## Pass 3 — The rite (no wishes)

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | (On a save with no kingdom) wish `r_FounderBasin`, fill it with 8+ drams of water | Inventory action **found a settlement** appears |
| 16 | Use it, name the settlement | Ceremony popup; founded + zone claimed; basin drained by 8 |

## Pass 3b — Charter, chronicle registers, and reset

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 16a | After founding: check the abilities menu | A **Charter** ability exists (Kingdom class); activating it opens Status / The Chronicle / As others tell it / Standings |
| 16b | Read "As others tell it" | Same events retold with rumor leads ("Travelers claim that...", "Some deny that...") |
| 16c | Talk to an arrived settler | Greeting + "Why did you come?" answer naming their origin |
| 16d | Walk one zone away (non-adjacent claim test: travel 2+ zones), `kingdom:claim` | Refused — claims must border existing ground (`kingdom:claimforce` overrides) |
| 16e | Let the settlement stay dry for 3+ growth passes at Steading | **Withered** flag in status + chronicle line; refill water and grow | Recovery message and chronicle entry |
| 16f | `kingdom:reset` (confirm) | Kingdom dissolved; Charter ability gone; ready to re-test founding from scratch |

## Pass 5 — Districts and commissions

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 20 | Charter → **Designate district** in a claimed zone → market | Chronicle line; status unchanged otherwise |
| 21 | `kingdom:status` | (Market district shortens arrival intervals by 10% — verify next arrival tick moved after next growth pass) |
| 22 | Charter → **Commission a building** → cask rack (4 drams in stores needed) | Stores −4; scaffolding appears nearby; chronicle line |
| 23 | Wait ~1200 ticks (or explore and return) | Scaffold becomes the cask rack; completion message + chronicle |
| 24 | Commission the great cistern (16 drams) | Same cycle; stored capacity +256 when done |
| 25 | Commission a communal bunk; watch settlers at night | A settler eventually sleeps in it (vanilla bed behavior) |
| 25a | On first reaching Steading | "A settler has taken up the trade" — the first stall opens; trade with them shows tier-1 stock |
| 25c | Charter → Commission | The design list is loaded from KingdomBuildings.xml (5 entries); third-party mods shipping their own `<kingdombuildings>` file extend it automatically |
| 25b | Browse vanilla tier-1 merchants elsewhere | The founder's basin occasionally appears for sale (8% per restock) — the legitimate acquisition path |

## Pass 6 — Raids and tribute

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 26 | Reach Steading; `kingdom:standing Snapjaws:-300`; leave and re-enter the claimed zone | Warning: snapjaw scouts seen; chronicle line (needs raid cooldown elapsed — or use `kingdom:raid` to force) |
| 27 | Charter → **Pay tribute** (12 drams in stores) | Raid averted; snapjaw standing +50; chronicle line |
| 28 | Force again via `kingdom:raid`, don't pay, wait out the lead (or `kingdom:raid` again) | 2+ snapjaws spawn at the zone edge and attack citizens; chronicle records the raid |
| 29 | After the fight: `kingdom:status`, `kingdom:chronicle` | State coherent; raid recorded in both registers |

## Pass 4 — Attitudes and persistence

| Step | Action | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | With Snapjaws standing at 600, wish `snapjaw scavenger` near a citizen | It does NOT attack the citizen (it may still dislike *you* — that's the two ledgers) |
| 18 | Save → quit to menu → reload | `kingdom:status` + `kingdom:chronicle` intact; selftest still all-PASS |
| 19 | Player.log | No "Bad event bind", no exceptions from ThousandAndFirst |

## Known v0 limits (not bugs)

- No ownership stamping on claims (can't rob your own city — membership design pending).
- Settlers use vanilla farmer behavior; ambient roles come with the amenity work.
- Stage never regresses; the withered overlay is designed but not yet built.
- Founder's basin is wish-obtainable only; its acquisition quest is slice 0.2 content.
